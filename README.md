# React: Learning Events, State, and Lists

This project is to learn and understand the core concepts of React. The main focus areas of this project are:

Event Handlers
State Management
Lists in React

In this project, I will explore how to handle events in React. Event handlers are functions that are triggered when a certain event occurs.

State management is a crucial part of any React application. In this project, I will learn how to create and manage state in a React component. I will explore how state changes affect the component and how to use state to control component behavior.

React uses lists to display multiple elements of the same type. In this project, I will learn how to create and manage lists in React. I will explore how to use the map function to create lists and how to handle events in lists.
